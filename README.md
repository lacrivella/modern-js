## HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
overview of the medium article presented in the documentation
- created by **Brendan Eich** in '95 during his time at Netscape
- Netscape joined forces with Sun in order to compete with Microsoft/Internet Explorer
- *JavaScript* was originally suppose to be a companion language to *Java* (ala *Visual Basic* is to *C++*)
- Sun never truly saw JS as a competitor to Java -> clearly they be wrong
- **Douglas Crickford** pioneered/rediscovered JS with his invention of JSON data formatting
- JavaScript has become the defacto standard programming language of the web since it works excelently with *DOM* ([Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction))

## VARIABLES

### Types 
const = constant -> cannot be overwritten
let = can be reassigned
var = old way before ES6 -> like 'let' it also can be reassigned

By default it is always best to start off with const.

When it comes to naming variables, they must be computer friendly/no spaces/no special characters or numbers. Either use **camelCase** or **snake_case**.
Be specific with your variable names, after all naing is a process.

## DATA TYPES
JavaScript is a dynamic language that does not need you to define the type of variables
